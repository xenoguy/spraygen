# spraygen

This project hasn't been updated in 8 years.  I'm not sure if it even works right now.

There is a currently maintained and actively developed project for the same purpose over here: https://mishcatt.github.io/VTF-Editor

And the github repo for it here: https://github.com/Mishcatt/VTF-Editor

A front end to vtex (source SDK tool) to:
-create fading sprays using mipmap levels
-create animated sprays from animated gifs

Written in python 2.x
